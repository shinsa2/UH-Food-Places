The salad was full of wilted lettuce.  The service is consistently terrible.  Workers are reluctant to help.  Food takes extra long to come.  For example, a sandwich takes 1/2 hour to come out when I was told 10 minutes.Go here if you like to gamble on taste of the food and be prepared to wait long for it.",

The rice and beans were alright and nothing special. Their tacos were ok. They could use more flavoring and maybe add more moisture in it (kinda dry). I had them for lunch and for dinner I went over to my friends place for a taco bar party so I had tacos for both lunch and dinner. My friends tacos were far more tasty and I felt like I wasted my money on my lunch. Overall I think you can make better tacos yourself but if you are really craving some tacos this is a easy solution.",

Both were really delicious! To top it off, I noticed the Ube dessert sign prior to ordering and completely forgot after ordering.

Fun, casual and friendly staff.  Mathieu was very kind,  we spoke about crepes of course.  Terrific crepes with fresh ingredients.  Thanks guys for  bringing some of our culture in this paradise.  You rock",

      "review": "Went here with my friend we both ordered savory crepes. They're amazing, very light and flavourful!! The customer service is top notch as well. Our server was tentative, took our order and made them right away. Then charged us later, it's the aloha spirit!  Don't forget to try their coffee too. I had an Americano and my friend had a French roast. Both just black and are amazing. So smooth, warm and full bodied. No need for cream or sugar.  We are coming back tomorrow and so excited to try other crepes!!",
